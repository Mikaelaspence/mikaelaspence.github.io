        <h1>Milestone Two Narrative: Software Design and Engineering Enhancement</h1>
        
        <p>The artifact chosen for this milestone was from the CS course 360. The artifact is an Android app that manages events and was called EventTrackerApp. I selected this item because I saw there was much room for improvement on this project and wanted to implement some useful changes that would show my development in computer coding techniques since the completion of that course. The original artifact was created on August 25th, 2024.</p>

        <p>This artifact was included in my portfolio because I saw room for several improvements. For the software design and engineering component, I wanted to showcase using an MVC pattern, which is useful for making my code more modular, maintainable, and scalable compared to the original design. I added an event controller class to handle operations that were previously in the database helper class. Now, user management and event management are separated, which prevents UI logic from interfering with database operations, reducing coupling. This solution follows industry best practice standards and makes for easier debugging and future expansion. Finally, as discussed in the code review video, I removed unused methods at lines 108 and 129 in my original database helper.</p>

        <p>I believe this enhancement reflects my proposed enhancement plans from last weekâ€™s work. I do not need to update the plan currently, at least until I have feedback from my professor.</p>

        <p>The only real problem encountered when enhancing my artifact was finding all of the places within my previous files that needed to be updated in order to enact the new event controller class. It was referenced between multiple files.</p>
