                <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 32px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #b39ddb;">Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
                <p>Hi, my name is Mikaela Spence, and I am a Computer Science major set to graduate in March 2025. Two years ago, I started the Computer Science program at SNHU as my third degree. 
                I currently hold a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and a Master of Science in Nursing, working full-time as a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner. 
                I decided to return to school for a second Bachelor’s degree for several reasons. I have always been passionate about computers and coding, making my first HTML website 
                while in middle school, around 1997, when the internet was far less common than it is today. It felt like magic to type in words that made something happen on the screen. 
                Although my professional career led me in a different direction, my passion for coding remained. In 2022 I decided to go back to school, not to change professions, but to learn more. 
                I have interest in making my own games and programs, mostly for myself and my friend group. In the future, I may decide to pursue this further, but for now, it is a hobby project of mine.</p>

                <p>Should I decide to change course and pursue a career in Computer Science, my coursework at SNHU and in my capstone course (which this portfolio highlights) have prepared me in many ways for a position in the field. 
                My coursework has given me experience in many different aspects of working in computer science, including collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, 
                data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security.</p>

                <h2>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h2>
                <p>My coursework provided many opportunities to collaborate in a team environment. Each course included discussion posts where students reviewed peer work, provided feedback, 
                and suggested improvements. In CS 250, we learned about project management and Scrum methodologies, practicing various roles and responsibilities as team members. 
                This course focused on working together to complete projects. In several of the GAM courses I took, collaborating with peers to figure out problems and discuss possible solutions was a major part of the work.</p>

                <h2>Communicating with Stakeholders</h2>
                <p>In my time at SNHU as a student, I did not get the opportunity to interact directly with stakeholders. However, several courses incorporated simulated interactions with stakeholders. 
                I learned different ways to provide updates on projects depending on the audience, when to use more technical terms, and when to use lay language. CS 250 involved creating a design document 
                for a gaming company and presenting the information to various audiences, including project team members, managers, stakeholders, and customers.</p>

                <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
                <p>CS 300 was a course based around data structures and algorithms. In this course, I learned the differences between various algorithms and examples of when one algorithm may be more appropriate than another. 
                I learned in particular about linear searches, binary search trees, and hash tables. Each algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages, and selecting the most appropriate one depends on the use case. 
                I wrote a program in this course using each search method for different sized data sets and analyzed the amount of time the search took, emphasizing the difference between time and efficiency.</p>

                <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
                <p>Software engineering was a skill practiced throughout many courses during my time at SNHU. In two courses, we focused on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
                One was a broad introduction to the idea of a software development life cycle, with papers and projects on planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. 
                Another course, CS 320 (Software Testing and Automation), focused significantly on testing and its place in the SDLC. Several courses involved using JUnit for unit and integration testing in Java applications, 
                where I applied test-driven development (TDD) principles. I also have experience using Jupyter Notebook for interactive testing and debugging of data processing pipelines from my work in CS 370, 
                which had me interacting with machine learning principles and practice. My final project below is an example of my experience updating an existing project to use the Model View Controller (MVC) 
                software design pattern to better organize the application’s code.</p>

                <h2>Databases</h2>
                <p>Throughout the program, I gained a good deal of experience working with different databases. In “Introduction to Structured Database Environments,” I learned how to use MySQL, 
                execute queries, enable CRUD functionality, and integrate a database into a project. In CS 360, I developed a project using SQLite, integrating the database into an event-tracking application. 
                In my full-stack development course, I gained experience working with a NoSQL database, MongoDB, and incorporated it into a website for travel destinations. For my final project displayed below, 
                I added an online database to my event application, Firebase Firestore, and integrated it into the project along with the SQLite database.</p>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>Security is a growing concern in the computer science field. SNHU coursework discussed security in almost every course. CS 305, Software Security, was a course that focused on writing secure code, 
                looking for vulnerabilities in dependencies, and working with OWASP. I learned about various security threats, including how hackers exploit vulnerabilities. My client/server development course 
                emphasized security when transmitting data between systems. I learned in this course about making security certificates for a website, how they are generated, and why they are important. 
                I now have experience writing secure code and implementing strategies to prevent security vulnerabilities such as DDoS attacks, injection attacks, weak authentication, improper password storage, 
                and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).</p>

                <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 32px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #b39ddb;">Introduction to This Project</h1>
                <p>The following sections of my ePortfolio all focus on my Computer Science 499 Capstone project. For this project, I took an artifact from a previous course and enhanced it in several important ways. 
                The initial project involved editing given code to create an application that could track events with CRUD functionality. The requirement for this capstone course was to enhance the artifact in three 
                major categories: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Below you will find my code review and transcript, a short description of each artifact category with the 
                updated code and an in-depth narrative, and my final finished project. Each enhancement demonstrates my growth throughout the program and showcases my current abilities.</p>
